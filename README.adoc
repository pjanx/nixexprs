Nix expressions
===============

This is a Nix channel for bleeding-edge versions of my projects.
While it primarily serves my own needs, you may use it to try the software out.

.Example 1: Just build a project, without commitment
 $ nix-build https://git.janouch.name/p/nixexprs/archive/master.tar.gz -A fiv-master
 $ ./result/bin/fiv

.Example 2: Install the project
 $ nix-env -f https://git.janouch.name/p/nixexprs/archive/master.tar.gz -iA fiv-master

By default, all optional features are enabled.  For the sake of simplicity,
all you can do about it is to go to the other extreme, using `--arg full false`.
